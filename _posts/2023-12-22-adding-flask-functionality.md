### Summary ###

In this post, we expand on the groundwork laid by the previous blog post - located [here.](log-your-feelings.md)

The focus will be on adding index pages that allow the user to see previously added form entries, and tags.

Then, we will create a simple form that allows a user to add new feeling categories to be used in future form entries.

Last of all, we will implement a site-wide search functionality by updating the base.html template.

### Part 1: showing previous form entries ###

### Part 2: showing previous tags ###
