Recently, I noticed that my WiFi setup was not great - some devices were trying to do too much!

For example, the modem provided by my Internet Service Provider (ISP) was bridging, routing packets, Serving DHCP and DNS requests and propagating a WiFi signal. This is convenient for most people that want a product that "just works" out of the box - but it can overwork the hardware.


To address this issue I decided to split out the network infrastructure for redundancy and better load balancing of services. 


Some time ago, I started buying hardware in pairs. Once I decide on a hardware platform for a specific purpose - I buy two units and keep one unit in storage. I also purchase used or refurbished whenever possible to offset the price increase when buying two units.


This is a list of requirements that must be met in order for the infrastructure to be "wife approved":
    
1. Less than 1% internet downtime due to maintenance or mis-configuration.
2. Seamless roaming between access points anywhere on 1/3rd acre property.
3. Ability to disconnect clients manually, or on a schedule.
4. No subscription or cloud-based services required.

This is a list of features that were desired, but not required:

1. Collect, graph and analyze Lan, Wifi, and WAN traffic.
2. Fast (under 5 minutes) AP replacements.
3. Devices follow the unix philosophy "Do one thing, do it well"


Here is a breakdown of the network hardware used:

1. Router/Firewall - 

2. Ethernet Switching - 
    - Gigabit Switch:
    - PoE switch:
3. Wifi Equipment -
