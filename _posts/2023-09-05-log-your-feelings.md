## A simple micro-blogging app meant to be used to be used anonymously ##

### Features: ###

  - Search tags by keyword
  - Data is stored in a SQLite3 database


### Project Summary ###

    The purpose of this project is to create an example application that is actually pretty useful.

While it is a toy application, lacking features that would be required to make it a _product_
it includes all the components of a normal web application (Frontend presentation, Backend app logic, Database to store records).

This application is used in a separate blog post ["Dev Setup Guide"](2023-08-10-dev-setup-guide)
